//Strings
//Input Format: You are given two strings,  and , separated by a new line. Each string will consist of lower case Latin characters ('a'-'z').
//Output Format: In the first line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of  and  respectively.
//In the second line print the string produced by concatenating  and  ().
//In the third line print two strings separated by a space,  and .  and  are the same as  and , respectively, except that their first characters are swapped.
